Plan:
Terraform Setup: I'll use Terraform to create all the required AWS resources, ensuring no manual steps (clickops) in the AWS Console. Terraform will manage EC2, Lambda, CloudFront, and S3.

Networking:
I'll set up a VPC with private subnets, so resources like EC2 will be in a private network.
CloudFront will be the only publicly accessible service, with TLS optional for now.

EC2 and WebSocket:
The EC2 instance will run the backend, and the WebSocket API will be hosted on it.
I'll configure Terraform to install and run the backend API automatically during instance provisioning (using User Data).

S3 Bucket and Frontend:
I'll upload the frontend code to an S3 bucket and serve it through CloudFront.

Security:
A Security Group will be attached to the EC2 instance to allow WebSocket traffic.
CloudFront will manage access control.
HTTP-only cookies will be used to reject requests to /api/v1/ws as per the task's criteria.
Tagging:

All resources created will be tagged with poc01-* to meet the tagging requirements.
Terraform Module: Superterr.tf
